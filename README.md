# ML-model-to-predict-the-success-of-an-ICO
Designed a successful ML model to predict the success of an ICO (Initial coin offering) by applying dfferent ML algorithms such as Random Forest, KNN and SVM, measured the performance and accuracy using different performance metrices such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1score and ROC-AUC. This ML model was capable enough to handle unbalanced binary classification problems.
